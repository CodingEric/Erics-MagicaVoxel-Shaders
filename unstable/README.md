### HYPERFLOOD
>**UNSTABLE. DO NOT USE.<br>GO TO FLOW2 INSTEAD.**

>Unlike the classic flood shader, this shader provides a solution for closed water area.
* File name: `hyperflood.txt`
* Command-line usage: `xs hyperflood [x] [y] [z]` (The parameters represent the coordinate of the water source.)
* Command-line e.g.: `xs hyperflood 3 5 3`
>1. The color of water is controlled by selected color in the palette.
>2. DANGER - READ BEFORE USE
<br>- THE SHADER ONLY SUPPORTS SCENES WITH LESS THAN 40 UNITS OF XYZ-VOLUMESIZE. (You can change line 17 to remove the limit, but think over first.)
<br>- LIMITED BY THE INNER EXPLAINATOR OF MAGICAVOXEL, THE SHADER IS NOT STABLE. IF THE FILLING SPACE IS TOO LARGE, MAGICAVOXEL MAY CRASH.
